# 🖥️ Module 1 – Introduction to IT

Today I learnt the basics of IT, and honestly, it feels like I just unlocked the “behind-the-scenes” of how computers run our world.

**What is IT?**
IT is basically using computers, the internet, and digital technology to store and process information. It’s everywhere. The people in IT make sure systems don’t crash, printers actually work (sometimes 😅), and everything stays secure.

**From Ada Lovelace to Algorithms**
I found out that the first person to ever write a computer program was *Ada Lovelace* (in the 1800s!). She came up with the first **algorithm** – which is really just a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem. Feels simple, but it’s literally the foundation of programming.

**The Path of Modern Computers**
During World War II, computers took a giant leap. They were used in **cryptography** (code-making and code-breaking) to send secure information. Imagine trusting a human to solve those codes by hand… not happening. Computers proved their speed here.

**Computer Language**
This part was fascinating. Computers only understand **binary** – just 0s and 1s.
Example:
`01001000 = H`
`01100101 = e`
`01101100 = l`
`01101111 = o`

So, at the end of the day, all the apps, videos, and games we enjoy are really just massive chains of ones and zeros. Mind-blowing.

**Character Encoding**
Binary alone isn’t enough. We need a way to map those 1s and 0s into actual letters and symbols we can understand. That’s where **ASCII** and **Unicode** come in — they act like translators, turning binary into text, numbers, emojis, and more.

**Abstraction**
Abstraction is about hiding complexity. I don’t need to know how every transistor in my laptop works to type these notes. Just like you don’t need to know car engine mechanics to drive. This concept keeps systems organized and manageable.

**Computer Layers**
I also learnt about the main layers of a computer:

* **User** – people like us, interacting with the machine.
* **Software** – apps/programs we run.
* **Operating System (OS)** – the middle manager that controls everything.
* **Hardware** – the physical parts: CPU, memory, disks, etc.

Each layer depends on the other, and problems in one can easily affect the rest.

✅ End of Module 1.
Not too much, but enough to make me realize: computers look simple on the outside, but deep down it’s algorithms, codes, and 0s & 1s running the show.
